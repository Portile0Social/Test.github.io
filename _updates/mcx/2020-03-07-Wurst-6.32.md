## Changelog

- Added a ["Switch back" checkbox](https://wurst.wiki/autotool#switch_back) to AutoTool's settings. When checked, AutoTool will automatically switch back to the previously selected slot.

- Added a "Middle click friends" checkbox to `.friends` (you can only see this by using [Navigator](https://wurst.wiki/navigator)). Does the same thing as the button in the Wurst Options.

- `.blink cancel` will now show an error message if Blink is already turned off.

- Added [AntiWaterPush](https://wurst.wiki/antiwaterpush): Prevents you from getting pushed by water. Also has a "Prevent slowdown" checkbox in that allows you to walk underwater at full speed.

- [AntiKnockback](https://wurst.wiki/antiknockback) will no longer prevent you from getting pushed by water.

- NoSlowdown will no longer prevent slowness caused by being underwater. (Use the "Prevent slowdown" checkbox in AntiWaterPush instead.)

- Added a ["Tree" template](https://wurst.wiki/autobuild#default_templates) to AutoBuild. (If you don't see this, reset your AutoBuild templates or delete the `.minecraft/wurst/autobuild` folder.)

- Added a ["Range" slider](https://wurst.wiki/autobuild#range) to AutoBuild: Determines how far to reach when placing blocks.

  (In previous versions, "Fast" mode locked this setting to 6.0 and "Legit" mode locked it to 4.25.)

- Added a ["Check line of sight" checkbox](https://wurst.wiki/autobuild#check_line_of_sight) to AutoBuild: Makes sure that you don't reach through walls when placing blocks. Can help with AntiCheat plugins but slows down building.

  (In previous versions, "Legit" mode enabled this setting.)

- Added [AntiWobble](https://wurst.wiki/antiwobble): Disables the wobble effect caused by nausea and portals.

- <a href="https://wurst.wiki/antiblind">AntiBlind</a> no longer disables the wobble effect caused by nausea and portals.

- Added an "Eat while walking" checkbox to AutoEat (unchecked by default).

- Added a "Prefer food with" setting to AutoEat that determines how it will decide which food to eat first. By default, AutoEat will choose the food with the highest saturation.

- Added an "Allow hunger effect" checkbox to AutoEat (checked by default). When checked, AutoEat may eat food that gives you the harmless 'hunger' effect (e.g. rotten flesh).

- Added an "Allow poison effect" checkbox to AutoEat (unchecked by default). When checked, AutoEat may eat food that gives you the poison effect (e.g. spider eyes).

- Added an "Allow chorus fruit" checkbox to AutoEat (unchecked by default). When checked, AutoEat may eat chorus fruits, which will teleport you around randomly. (MC 1.12, 1.12-OF)

- Improved AutoEat's search tags.

- Changed the [category](https://wurst.wiki/categories) of AutoEat from "Other" to "Items".

- Removed AutoEat's "Ignore screen" checkbox.

- Improved the description of [AutoLeave](https://wurst.wiki/autoleave) and its settings.

- Improved [AutoLeave](https://wurst.wiki/autoleave)'s search tags.

- Improved the description of CrashChest.

- Added a "CleanUp" entry in Navigator.

- Added a "LastServer" entry in Navigator.

- Added a "Reconnect" entry in Navigator.

- Added a "WurstCapes" entry in Navigator.

- Fixed ScaffoldWalk placing sand in places where it would fall.

- Fixed enabled hacks not loading properly when Reach is enabled. (The state of Reach will no longer be saved)

## Update: Wurst 6.32.1

- Alt Manager will now rename a corrupted alt list file instead of deleting it.

- Alt Manager will no longer try to check every alt as soon as you add it to your alt list, as this can cause Mojang's authentication servers to temporarily ban your IP address.

- Fixed Alt Manager counting unchecked alts as premium.

- Fixed ScaffoldWalk not placing glass blocks.

- Fixed [Search](https://wurst.wiki/search) not resetting when going to a different dimension.

- Fixed Derp, Headless, HeadRoll and Tired not disabling each other.
